Flintoclass was an award-winning multi-sensory learning platform driving accessibility and inclusion in early education. I co-founded the company and led product design from inception through acquisition.

## Overview

Early childhood education faces unique challenges—young learners have varying attention spans, learning styles, and developmental stages. Traditional one-size-fits-all approaches often leave children behind.

## The Solution

We created a multi-sensory learning experience that adapts to each child's needs, combining physical activity kits with digital content that reinforces learning through multiple modalities.

## Impact

- Reached thousands of children across India
- Won multiple awards for innovation in education
- Successfully acquired by an industry leader
