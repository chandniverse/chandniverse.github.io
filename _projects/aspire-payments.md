A robust financial system is essential for any team, and startups cannot afford to be weighed down by elaborate approval processes. At Aspire, I designed seamless, agile payments solutions customised for the speed of startups.

## The Challenge

Startup teams need to move fast. Traditional financial tools built for enterprises create friction at every turn—complex approval workflows, slow processing times, and interfaces designed for finance teams rather than busy founders.

## My Role

As the lead product designer, I was responsible for:
- User research and journey mapping
- Interaction design and prototyping
- Design system development
- Cross-functional collaboration with engineering and product

## Process

### Research & Discovery

We started by interviewing 30+ startup founders and finance leads to understand their pain points with existing solutions...

### Design & Iteration

Through rapid prototyping and user testing, we refined our approach...

## Results

The redesigned payment flow reduced time-to-completion by 60% and increased user satisfaction scores significantly.
