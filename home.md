# The Thoughtful Technologist

## Welcome to The Thoughtful Technologist (TTT)

Technology is never neutral. It encodes histories, politics, and biases into the systems we interact with every day. *The Thoughtful Technologist* examines how these systems shape society, governance, and the economy—and asks how we can design better futures.

### Subscribers receive:
- ✅ Weekly deep dives into topics like AI policy, digital public infrastructure, feminist finance, and algorithmic governance.
- ✅ Sharp opinion pieces challenging the status quo of technology discourse.
- ✅ Theoretical explorations in digital sociology, economics, and design futures.
- ✅ Global perspectives connecting technology to governance, culture, and economic development.

If you’re a researcher, policymaker, designer, or just someone who refuses to take technology at face value, TTT is your space to explore, critique, and build better futures.
