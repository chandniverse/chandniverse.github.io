## The Beginning

Every story has a beginning. This is where we set the scene and introduce the context for what's to come. @cr-scene1

The reader scrolls through your narrative while the visuals stay fixed, creating an immersive reading experience.

Scrollytelling works particularly well for data journalism, documentary storytelling, educational content, and research communication.
