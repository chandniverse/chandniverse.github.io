This is a sample blog post. You can write your posts in markdown and they'll automatically appear on the blog page.

## How to add a new post

1. Create a new file in `_posts/` folder
2. Name it `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`
3. Add the front matter at the top (like this post has)
4. Write your content in markdown

## Markdown examples

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and `code` formatting.

> This is a blockquote

```python
# And code blocks
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

That's it! Delete this post when you're ready to write your own.
