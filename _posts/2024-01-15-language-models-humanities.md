Language models are often discussed in terms of their generative capabilities—writing essays, code, and creative content. But beneath the surface lies something perhaps more valuable for researchers: their ability to analyze and understand text at scale.

## Beyond Generation

While text generation captures headlines, the analytical capabilities of large language models offer transformative potential for humanities research. These models can identify patterns, themes, and relationships across vast corpora that would take human researchers years to process manually.

## Practical Applications

### Thematic Analysis
Language models can help identify recurring themes across hundreds of documents, surfacing connections that might otherwise go unnoticed.

### Sentiment and Tone
Understanding the emotional register of historical texts, correspondence, or literary works becomes tractable at scale.

### Cross-referencing
Finding intertextual references and influences across large bodies of work.

## Considerations

Of course, these tools require careful, critical application. They're best used as aids to human interpretation rather than replacements for it.
