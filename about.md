Hello! I'm Chandni Naidu Deadwyler—a product designer and researcher with a passion for human-computer interaction, accessibility, and building products that make a meaningful impact.

## What I Do

I specialize in product design, research, and strategy across finance, healthcare, and education technology. My work spans the full spectrum from early-stage research and discovery to design execution and team leadership.

## Background

I've had the privilege of working on products that reach millions of users, from financial tools that power startups to educational platforms that support early childhood development.

Some highlights:
- Led product design at **Aspire**, creating seamless payment solutions for startups
- Co-founded **Flintoclass**, an award-winning multi-sensory learning platform (acquired)
- Conducted research on digital inclusion and emergent technology users in India
- Designed tools for financial inclusion in Indonesia

## Currently

I'm based in NYC and open to full-time roles or contracts in product design, research, and strategy. I'm particularly interested in opportunities within finance, healthcare, and education technology.
